    <h1>FRONTEND DEVELPMENT</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2 style="background-color: rgb(202, 32, 32);">Languages</h2>
    <p>It is obvious, that you should start with <a target="_blank"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_Application">wikipedia the free encyclopedia</a> languages. Learn
        <b>html</b>, then master <b> CSS</b> and start
        <b>JavaScript</b>. These
        three languages are the base on your way to top front end development. As mentioned before, all online web
        design classes includes <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>JavaScript</b> <i style="background-color: green;"> into their courses
        </i> </p>

    <p> <b>HTML</b> isn’t a programming language per se, but <a target="_blank"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_Application">wikipedia html</a> it is used to describe how elements
        on a page should be laid out.
        Another function of <b>html</b> consists in providing browser with a list of all the files (first of all CSS and
        JavaScript), that are required for the appropriate website’s look and feel.
        <br>
        In its turn,<b>css</b> describes the look of every page. It controls <a target="_blank"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_Application">wikipedia the free CSS
        </a> colors, fonts, and even some animations. CSS is
        not a programming language. Being a text document, it is responsible for making a website’s look great.
        <br>
        Of these three web languages, only Javascript <a target="_blank"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_Application">wikipedia the free javascript</a> is the one that is
        considered an actual programming language. It
        controls interactions on a site. You don’t need much <b>javascript</b> for static websites, but it is widely
        used for
        dynamic ones. Thus, dynamic websites require an in-depth understanding of <b>Javascript</b>

    <div style="background-color: rgb(139, 34, 48);">
    <p>Learning <b>web design techniques</b> is your second stage. Start with <b> responsive design</b>, then go to <b>
            modern design languages</b>
        and finish the stage with <b>frameworks</b>.

        With the wide use of smartphones and tablets, <b>responsive</b> design should be among your key approaches to
        the work
        you do. People expect websites to look perfect on every device, and you are able to satisfy this need only with
        the help of <b> responsive design principles.</b>

        Under <b>design language,</b> we understand a set of principles used to unify and organize the look of a
        product.
        Material Design by Google is one of the most illustrative examples. It is a modern design language, developed
        for mobile apps, responsive websites, and other digital products. Material Design is used to unify user
        experience on different devices within Google ecosystem and beyond.

        <b>Frameworks</b> are required for structuring and
        building websites. They rely on custom <b>css</b> classes, so all the content looks great on every device. With
        the
        right framework, front end developer is able to follow modern design principles and best practices of the
        industry.

    <h1 style="font-size: sans;">web apps</h1>
    <br>
    <p>After you have mastered <b>web design techniques</b>, it is time to start your acquaintance with web apps.
        Javascript
        frameworks and templating are the core aspects you should understand to become a rock star front end developer.
        User profiles on social networks have the same layout, because of templating engines which are used to create
        dynamic websites. By mastering the use of templating engines, you will make the first step in building a web
        application. Here are a few examples:</p>

    <ul>
        <li> <b>Angular</b> and <b>Ember</b> are frameworks with a templating engine;</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Handlebars</b> and <b> Mustache</b> are templating engines</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 style="font-size: sans;">peripheral skills</h2>
    <p>Of course, the aforementioned steps are not enough to become a high quality front end developer. You should also
        master a lot of peripheral skills. For example, a <b> source code control. Git</b> helps software developers
        around the
        world maintain the code of complex projects.
        <br>

        <b>Web performance</b> is another important topic for every front end developer. Keep in mind, that web site
        should not
        only look good, but it has to work fast. With the understanding of browser rendering core principles, developer
        is able to deliver a fast and efficient website to its users.
